                <h2>Word Hunt</h2>
                <p>The Word Hunt game is a grid-based word search where players find hidden words within a randomized letter grid. Players can choose from three difficulty levels—Easy, Medium, and Hard—each increasing the grid size and the number of words to find.

                    The game randomly selects words and places them strategically within the grid while filling the remaining spaces with random letters. Players have a limited time to identify words, and a built-in timer creates urgency. Once the time expires, the game evaluates performance and displays whether the player wins or loses.</p>

                <h2>Matrix-Based Encryption & Decryption System</h2>
                <p>This program implements a matrix-based encryption and decryption system that secures messages using matrix multiplication. A random 3x3 key matrix is generated to encode the message, which is then converted into a numerical matrix and encrypted through multiplication with the key matrix. To decrypt, the system calculates the inverse of the key matrix and applies it to the encrypted matrix, restoring the original message. The program supports manual input and file handling, ensuring flexibility in message encryption. Additionally, it features error handling, loading animations, and a colorful interface to enhance user experience while maintaining data security.</p>
